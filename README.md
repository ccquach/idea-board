# Idea Board

The idea board app displays idea tiles, which can be rated, archived, and sorted. You can create, modify, and delete ideas. A motivational quote is fetched daily and displayed in a sticky footer. The background is created with Particles.js to create a fluid environment for free-flowing thought.
